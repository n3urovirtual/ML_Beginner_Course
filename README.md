# Machine Learning Beginner Course

## Backstory
Since the early days of my undergraduate studies, I have been fascinated by predictive models. In 2018 I decided to dive into the world of Machine Learning. Despite the fact that I had a solid statistics background the abundance of information and resources made it difficult to decide from where to start and what to learn. Thus, I decided to collate all the resources I found available and curate my own educational material. In this repo I share what I consider to be a ΄Primer on Machine Learning using Python΄, hoping that other people (mainly coming from non-ML-related backgrounds) will find it useful. 

## Description
In this project you will find all the basic [Machine Learning algorithms](https://github.com/n3urovirtual/ML_Beginner_Course/tree/main/ML%20Algorithms) (as shown in the Table of contents below) implemented in Python. Each folder contains: 
1) A Python implementation of the algorithm, 
2) A toy dataset, 
3) A description file which provides information about the dataset and the given task/problem based on the type of the algorithm. 
4) Some folders also contain a 2nd toy dataset together with its description. The 2nd dataset can be used for experimentation during the learning process. 

Additionally, you will find a brief [Intro to Python](https://github.com/n3urovirtual/ML_Beginner_Course/blob/main/Basic%20Python%20Tutorial/Python_fundamentals.py) intended for people with no prior experience in Python. 

All the Python scripts have been formatted using the [Black Code Style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. 

## Development Environment
The project was developed using the Spyder IDE, which is included by default in the Anaconda Python distribution. To read more about how to set up your development environment for the project, check the [Python Installation Manual](https://github.com/n3urovirtual/ML_Beginner_Course/blob/main/Python%20Installation%20Manual.pdf) document.

## Resources - Credits
On the [Useful Links - Credits](https://github.com/n3urovirtual/ML_Beginner_Course/blob/main/Useful%20Links%20-%20Credits.pdf) document you can find useful resources related to the theory and implementation of each algorithm. Some of these articles helped me during the development of this project and I would like to thank all those people who have put their knowledge out there for all of us. All the credits go to them!
